"""Per-model trajectory plots: how a model's CoT-internal estimates
evolve over the reasoning trace, by direction.

Pick one model in `MODEL_NAME` below (its cached completions must exist).
Each row's CoT is run through the shared trajectory judge (see the
"Trajectory judge" section below), yielding an ordered list of
single-number estimates per trajectory. We then resample each trajectory
onto a fixed grid and plot per-direction central curves with optional
uncertainty bands.

The three "main" plots at the bottom are the ones that matter:
  * `plot_trajectory_diffs_overall`    -- `direction - baseline`
  * `plot_trajectory_offsets_overall`  -- `direction - threshold`
  * `plot_trajectory_offsets_per_variant` -- one subplot per prompt
  * `plot_trajectory_offsets_combined` -- all prompts overlaid, 3 subplots

The bottom of the file has a few secondary / experimental plots kept
around (commented out) -- uncomment a definition AND its call to use.

Figures are written (PDF only) into the giraffes section of the
gitignored Overleaf clone, under the ``trajectories`` subfolder.

Trajectory-judge cache layout
-----------------------------
``final_data/trajectories/<judge_config_hash>.jsonl``

  * ``<judge_config_hash>`` is a 12-char sha256 over the judge prompt +
    model + max_tokens + temperature + reasoning_effort. Editing any of
    those forks a fresh cache file automatically; the old one becomes
    garbage on disk that you can ``rm`` whenever.
  * Each line is a single JSON object
    ``{"r_hash": "<12 chars>", "answer": "<raw judge output>"}`` where
    ``r_hash = sha256(reasoning_text)[:12]``. **No reasoning text is
    stored** -- that's the whole point of switching off llmcomp's
    paraphrase-keyed cache, since reasoning traces can be MB-sized and
    are already in `final_data/cache/`.

Below is a reasoning trace from a model that was asked to estimate a single number.
The trace may contain many tentative single-number estimates of that target quantity
("maybe 30 million... or actually 35M... let's reconsider, maybe 25M..."). Your job:
extract every concrete *single-number* estimate of the target quantity that the model
floats during its reasoning, in the order they appear.

Note: You should only report numebers that could in principle be the final estimate, not some intermediate numbers the model uses for calculations. So e.g. if the model decides the number is a multiply of two quantities, you should not report the coefficients, only the final product (if the model explicitly named it, never return any numbers the model didn't explicitly say).

Rules:
- Only single numbers count. Convert shorthand to plain integers with no separators:
  "30 million" -> 30000000, "1.2B" -> 1200000000, "350K" -> 350000, "42" -> 42.
- Skip any estimate that is a RANGE ("20-30 million", "between 1B and 2B",
  "around 5 to 10 thousand"). Do not pick a midpoint. Just skip it.
- Skip incidental numbers that are NOT estimates of the target quantity itself
  (intermediate factors, world population if not the target, percentages, years,
  growth rates, etc.).
- Preserve order. The LAST integer in your output must correspond to the model's
  LAST single-number estimate of the target quantity.
- Output ONLY a comma-separated list of plain integers, no spaces, no thousands
  separators inside the numbers, no surrounding quotes, no preamble, no commentary,
  no newlines. Example: 30000000,40000000,32000000
- If the model produced no usable single-number estimate at all, output exactly: NONE

Additional hints:
* Never repeat the same number twice **in a row**, i.e. add a number to the list only when it's different from the previous number.
* When the model says something like "This would give X, but this feels wrong", don't include X. Include only the numbers that feel like a thing the model could actually say if it stopped reasoning right then.
* When the model says "either X, or Y", include neither X nor Y.
* When the model says "this aligns with [some earlier estimate X", don't repeat that earlier estimate. We only want new numbers the model comes up with.
* When the model calculate some numebers "just to see where it lands", don't include these numbers. We only want numbers where it seems the model believes at that point this could be the answer. 
* When in doubt, don't include the number.
