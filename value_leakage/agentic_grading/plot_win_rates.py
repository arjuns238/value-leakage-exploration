"""Agentic answer-grading (rater label-bias) experiments: Alpaca & real-analysis proofs.

Jan Dubinski's rater-bias setup (branch `jd/rate-llm-answers`,
`janekd/rate_llm_answers` + `janekd/rate_llm_math`): per trial (= seed), an
agentic grader gets a CSV file with 10 questions x 4 candidate answers. All
four candidates are written by the same source model (`claude-haiku-4.5`) but
are tagged with four model labels -- `claude-opus-3`, `claude-haiku-3.5`,
`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` -- under a fresh random permutation per trial. The
grader reads the file from disk and picks the best answer per question, so
any per-label deviation from the uniform 25% win rate is label bias. Three
agentic graders: Claude Code (`claude-opus-4-7`), Codex (`gpt-5.4`), Qwen
(`qwen/qwen3.6-max-preview`).

Experiments covered here (the two named tasks, three grading harnesses each):

  - **alpaca**: AlpacaEval instruction-following questions. The plotted
    claude/codex win rates are their default-prompt runs from the
    `alpaca_fairness` cache (`fairness_instructions.py`); the qwen win rates
    are its own run, restricted to the ALPACA_PANEL_SEEDS panel.
  - **proofs_opus** / **proofs_gemini**: open-ended undergraduate
    real-analysis proofs (epsilon-delta limits, sequences, sup/inf, ...);
    problems authored by `claude-opus-4.7` resp. `gemini-3.1-pro`, proofs
    written by `claude-haiku-4.5`. No ground truth.
  - **proofs_proofnet**: same proof-grading task, but the problem statements
    are taken from the ProofNet benchmark (`hoskinson-center/proofnet`,
    Rudin + Pugh real-analysis subset) instead of being model-authored;
    proofs still written by `claude-haiku-4.5`. Three graders over 500
    permutations (codex 500, claude 497, qwen 453 completed). This is the
    math task reported in the paper.

All data is loaded from `final_data/answer_grading_cache/`, populated from
Jan's branch by `migrate_from_janekd.py` (same directory; run it once with a
worktree of `origin/jd/rate-llm-answers`); the `proofs_proofnet` entry is
populated by the sibling `build_proofnet_cache.py`. Nothing here calls any API.

Known data gotchas (verified against the branch at migration time):

  - `best_answers.csv` rows are just (question, answer); the picked label is
    NOT in the committed raw alpaca data (the per-seed replicate inputs and
    the alpaca answer cache are gitignored upstream). Per-label numbers
    therefore come from Jan's committed `analysis/per_label_per_seed_wins.csv`
    (fractional credit for byte-identical-answer ties, see
    `janekd/rate_llm_answers/analyze.py`), migrated verbatim.
  - The cross-grader CoT extraction (`rationales.jsonl` here; `trials_*.jsonl`
    upstream) does carry one `picked_label` per question. For the alpaca
    claude/codex graders it covers Jan's local 500-seed runs, a superset of
    the committed 250-seed run dirs.
  - proofs_gemini is unevenly complete: claude was interrupted at 92 trials
    and its committed analysis covers only the first 90; qwen completed
    105/150 attempts. Jan's analysis CSVs are kept as-is (claude n=90).
  - proofs_opus raw run dirs (250/250/217 trials) were deleted upstream; the
    per-seed rationales (with per-pick labels, rater text, and thinking text)
    survive, and the win rates recomputed from them reproduce the numbers in
    Jan's slide deck (`data/slides/make_plots.py`), asserted at migration.
  - Four alpaca trials are contaminated by self-identity leaks (the source
    model wrote "I'm Claude ..." into an answer, which interacts with the
    label): seeds 222367, 222480, 222483, 222541. Jan's `_dedup` sibling runs
    drop/replace exactly these; pass `drop_leak_seeds=True` to the loaders to
    drop them here. Of the qwen run's extra seeds >222582, only 222583-222586
    (the codex-dedup replacements) were leak-screened upstream; the rest were
    never audited.
